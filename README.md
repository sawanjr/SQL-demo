# MySQL Database Interaction with Python

This repository demonstrates how to interact with a MySQL database using Python and the `mysql-connector-python` library. It covers connecting to the database, performing basic SQL operations, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- MySQL Server
- `mysql-connector-python` library

You can install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install --user mysql-connector-python
```

### Connecting to the Database

To establish a connection to the database, follow these steps:

1. Open a Python environment.
2. Import the `mysql.connector` module.
3. Create a connection object, specifying the host, username, password, and database name.

```python
import mysql.connector

# Establish a connection to the database
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    database="your_database"
)
```

## Usage

### Selecting Data

To select data from the database and print it, use the following code:

```python
# Create a cursor object
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Select data from the Persons table
select_query = "SELECT * FROM Persons"
cursor.execute(select_query)
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Process and print the selected data
for row in rows:
    person_id, last_name, first_name, address, city = row
    print(f"Person ID: {person_id}, Name: {first_name} {last_name}, Address: {address}, City: {city}")
```

### Inserting Data

To insert new data into the database, you can use the following code as an example:

```python
# Insert data into the Persons table
insert_query = "INSERT INTO Persons (PersonID, LastName, FirstName, Address, City) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s)"
data_to_insert = (5, 'starc', 'mitchell', 'australlia', 'melbourne')
cursor.execute(insert_query, data_to_insert)

# Commit the insert operation to make the changes permanent
conn.commit()
```

### Deleting Data

To delete data from the database, you can use a DELETE query as shown in the provided code.
